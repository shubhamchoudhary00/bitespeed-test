Below is the endpoint to test the "identify" which was given for the test

https://bitespeed-ps19.onrender.com/api/identify
This is a post request , after selecting the type of request which is post ,
you can send the request parameters in the body which are email and phoneNumber

I have also added some additional endpoints for my testing purpose 

One of them is add-contact endpoint which will take email,phoneNumber and linkedPrecedence as request body parameters to create a new record in the database

Below is the endpoint for it, it is also a post request
